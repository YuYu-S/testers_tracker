Testers Tracker application
===========================
This application provides a yield summary for testers, along with detailed information on disk packs from the selected testers and an RCC summary.

All data is extracted based on user-defined intervals.

Run `build.py` to generate the applicationâ€™s executable file, which will be saved in a newly created folder called `output`.
